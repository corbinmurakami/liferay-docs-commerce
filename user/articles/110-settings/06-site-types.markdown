# Site Types [](id=site-types)

@commerce@ supports three *Site Types*: B2B, B2C, and B2C-B2B.

**B2B:** A business-to-businesss site assumes that all of your buyers' accounts
are business accounts, meaning that multiple users can be assigned to each
account.

**B2C:** A business-to-consumer site assumes that all of your buyers' accounts
are personal accounts, limiting the number of users per account to one.

**B2C-B2B:** This site uses accounts that are configurable as one type or the
other.

A B2C site's widgets will not recognize business accounts. Best practice is to
set a site's type as soon as you create it and avoid changing it thereafter.
