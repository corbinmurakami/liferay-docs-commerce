# Site Types [](id=site-types)

The site type setting configures the types of customer accounts a site will allow. A site type should match your store's business model, whether it be B2B, B2C or B2X.

**B2B:** A business-to-businesss site will only display business accounts. Business accounts can have one or more individual users. Generally speaking, this setting is the right choice for B2B sellers or B2C sellers whose customers are grouped into a single buying unit, for example households.

**B2C:** A business-to-consumer site will only display personal accounts. Personal accounts only have one user and that user's information is replicated on their account. Generally, speaking this is the right choice for B2C sellers or B2B sellers who do not care to support multiple users on a single business account.

**B2C-B2B:** A B2C-B2B site will allow both personal and business accounts. This is recommended for sellers who want to support both account types on the same site (B2X).

## Changing Site Types

Changing site types will change which accounts are displayed within a site's account management widget. If a virtual instance contains business accounts but a site's type is set to B2C, those accounts will continue to exist in the database but will not show up in the site's account management widget or be selectable by users.

It is best practice to set a site's type as soon as you create it and avoid changing it in the future.
